Finding similarities between items based on graphs.
Integrate this into recommender system. 
Add baselines to compare. 
There is a lot of graph data.
Graph embeddings (map nodes to vectors).

Apply machine learning algorithms to these vectors.
Similarity of nodes (connections and place in vector space).

Similarity based on structural context (and thus not distance between points).
Apply this in recommender systems.


Relevant lectures:
Construct graph from recommender data. Running pagerank on it.
Fast personilized pagerank.
SimRank. 


Messaure structural distance.
Use simple structural similarity methods.

Analysis section.

Proof reliability, explain with empirical and statistical data. 
Reliability will go to the appendix if we write a paper.
