#### Problem statement

**Problem statement 1**

* "Same manner as embedding" is a bit vague
  * We could develop an SVM that works on TET's
  * Define a kernel on the TET and have an SVM run on it

Both problem statement are very technical and specific. We could do with making them a bit broader.

"How can we use structural similarity for recommendations?"

"How can we recommend if we know  have structural similarity?"

"How can we define structural similarity for recommendations?"

**Things to look at**

Graph neural networks

* They are looking at node similarity but it is not always clear if they are looking at structural similarity or simrank kind of similarity. 

**Graph databases**

Neo4J or mySQL

NetworkX

TRANS-E

If we works with Graph databases we would have the flatten the data

We could look to XML style storage.

Graph databases adds overhead.

We might gain something or not.

Look at the repositories that Manfred sent to gain insight.
