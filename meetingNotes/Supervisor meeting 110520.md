## Supervisor meeting 11/05/20

* Next meeting will be on Zoom due to limitations of MS teams of not being able to see all people at once
* Next meeting on monday 14:00 
* Try and send our report on friday morning/afternoon (preferably morning) so both have more time to read through it.
* Try and devide what we would like Peter and Manfred to focus on when reading through it (aim for their competences).

### Results

* The RMSE scores look resonable
* Manfred does understands the baseline method entirely
* One could experiment with better features for TeT or better metadata for node2vec
* We can try and make scenarios where TET would recommend but where node2vec would fail. Try and fabricate some scenarios  that simulate this.
* Site with some results of different methods:
  * http://www.mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html
  * We could make an experiment on the dataset used here and see if we get the same results
  * Need to make sure that they have the same evaluation protocol
* Our results look resonable when compared with the results in the link above.

### Comments on the report

* Overall the paper is nice but with a few gaps and jumps here and there.
* We should not have an verbatum quotes from other papers in our own paper

* Never write a report that is a narative of our experience. 
  * Don't write a reading paper
  * Mention in our paper that we tried a few things and reference the appendix in our paper. 
  * Show and why SimGNN won't work.
