**Can we achieve better recommendations by creating features for graph nodes with counts of counts and TET's?**
1. Can we improve the recommendations by using structural similarity metrics?
2. Will this method improve explainability of recommendations?
3. Can counts of counts similarity improve recommendation predictions?
4. What are the differences between the distance metrics used on TET's?
5. What is the different results we can achieve by using these metrics on real world relational data.
