# pagerank
PageRank is an algorithm used by google that ranks web pages. the algorithm counts the number of and strength of links to a page to estimate the importance of a page.

the simplest way of calculating is $PR(A)={\frac {PR(B)}{L(B)}}+{\frac {PR(C)}{L(C)}}+{\frac {PR(D)}{L(D)}}$

where PR(x) is the PageRank of a given page an L(x) is the number of outbound links from a page.

PageRank can be calculated over several iterations.
