1. Can counts of counts and type extension trees be used in the same manner as embedding without converting the TET to a numeric value?
   * What distance metric are viable for tree comparisons?
   * How reliable can a recommender build on COC and TET be compared to an equivalent build on embedding?
   * What methods for transforming data to graphs are available?
   * What is the cost of this method?

2. Can we achieve better recommendations by creating features for graph nodes with counts of counts and TET's?
   * Can we improve the recommendations by using structural similarity metrics?
   * Will this method improve explainability of recommendations?
   * Can counts of counts similarity improve recommendation predictions?
   * What are the differences between the distance metrics used on TET's?
   * What is the different results we can achieve by using these metrics on real world relational data.
