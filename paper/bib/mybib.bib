We have described a system for reasoning about temporal intervals that is both expressive and computationally effective. The representation captures the temporal hierarchy implicit in many domains by using a hierarchy of reference intervals, which precisely control the amount of deduction performed automatically by the system. This approach is partially partially useful in domains where temporal information is imprecise and relative, and techniques such as dating are not possible."

abstract="The problem of discovering frequent arrangements of temporal intervals is studied. It is assumed that the database consists of sequences of events, where an event occurs during a time-interval. The goal is to mine temporal arrangements of event intervals that appear frequently in the database. The motivation of this work is the observation that in practice most events are not instantaneous but occur over a period of time and different events may occur concurrently. Thus, there are many practical applications that require mining such temporal correlations between intervals including the linguistic analysis of annotated data from American Sign Language as well as network and biological data. Three efficient methods to find frequent arrangements of temporal intervals are described; the first two are tree-based and use breadth and depth first search to mine the set of frequent arrangements, whereas the third one is prefix-based. The above methods apply efficient pruning techniques that include a set of constraints that add user-controlled focus into the mining process. Moreover, based on the extracted patterns a standard method for mining association rules is employed that applies different interestingness measures to evaluate the significance of the discovered patterns and rules. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated and compared with other approaches on real (American Sign Language annotations and network data) and large synthetic datasets.",

abstract="This research involves implementation of genetic network programming (GNP) and ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve the sequential rule mining problem for commercial recommendations in time-related transaction databases. Excellent recommender systems should be capable of detecting the customers' preference in a proactive and efficient manner, which requires exploring customers' potential needs with an accurate and timely approach. Due to the changing nature of customers' preferences and the differences with the traditional find-all-then-prune approach, the interesting temporal association rules are extracted by the metaheuristics, genetic algorithms-based method of GNP. Additionally, a useful model is constructed using the obtained rules to forecast future customer needs and an ACO approach to evolve the online recommender system continuously. The methodology is experimentally evaluated in a real-world application by analysing the customer database of an online supermarket.",

abstract = "Cancer is a worldwide problem and one of the leading causes of death. Increasing prevalence of cancer, particularly in developing countries, demands better understandings of the effectiveness and adverse consequences of different cancer treatment regimes in real patient populations. Current understandings of cancer treatment toxicities are often derived from either “clean” patient cohorts or coarse population statistics. Thus, it is difficult to get up-to-date and local assessments of treatment toxicities for specific cancer centers. To address these problems, we propose a novel and efficient method for discovering toxicity progression patterns in the form of temporal association rules (TARs). A temporal association rule is defined as a rule where the diagnosis codes in the right hand side (e.g., a combination of toxicities/complications) are temporally occurred after the diagnosis codes in the left hand side (e.g., a particular type of cancer treatment). Our method develops a lattice structure to efficiently discover TARs. More specifically, the lattice structure is first constructed to store all frequent diagnosis codes in the dataset. It is then traversed using the paternity relations among nodes to generate TARs. Our extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method in discovering major toxicity patterns in comparison with the temporal comorbidity analysis. In addition, our method significantly outperforms existing methods for mining TARs in terms of runtime."

abstract="The problem of discovering frequent arrangements of temporal intervals is studied. It is assumed that the database consists of sequences of events, where an event occurs during a time-interval. The goal is to mine temporal arrangements of event intervals that appear frequently in the database. The motivation of this work is the observation that in practice most events are not instantaneous but occur over a period of time and different events may occur concurrently. Thus, there are many practical applications that require mining such temporal correlations between intervals including the linguistic analysis of annotated data from American Sign Language as well as network and biological data. Three efficient methods to find frequent arrangements of temporal intervals are described; the first two are tree-based and use breadth and depth first search to mine the set of frequent arrangements, whereas the third one is prefix-based. The above methods apply efficient pruning techniques that include a set of constraints that add user-controlled focus into the mining process. Moreover, based on the extracted patterns a standard method for mining association rules is employed that applies different interestingness measures to evaluate the significance of the discovered patterns and rules. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated and compared with other approaches on real (American Sign Language annotations and network data) and large synthetic datasets.",

abstract="One of the most challenging problems in mining gene expression data is to identify how the expression of any particular gene affects the expression of other genes. To elucidate the relationships between genes, an association rule mining (ARM) method has been applied to microarray gene expression data. However, a conventional ARM method has a limit on extracting temporal dependencies between gene expressions, though the temporal information is indispensable to discover underlying regulation mechanisms in biological pathways. In this paper, we propose a novel method, referred to as temporal association rule mining (TARM), which can extract temporal dependencies among related genes. A temporal association rule has the form [gene A{\textuparrow}, gene B{\textdownarrow}] {\textrightarrow} (7 min) [gene C{\textuparrow}], which represents that high expression level of gene A and significant repression of gene B followed by significant expression of gene C after 7 minutes. The proposed TARM method is tested with Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle time-series microarray gene expression data set.",

In order to solve the problem of handling time series by including temporal relation between the multi items into association rules, a frequent itemsets tree is constructed in parallel with mining frequent itemsets to improve the efficiency and interpretability of rule mining without generating candidate itemsets. Experimental results show that our algorithm can provide better efficiency and interpretability in mining temporal association rules in comparison with other algorithms and has good application prospects."

abstract = "Current-generation recommendation algorithms are often focused on generic ratings prediction and item ranking tasks based on a user's past preferences. However, many recommendations are more complex with specific criteria and constraints on which items are relevant. This paper focuses on a particular type of complex recommendation needs: narrative-driven recommendation, where users describe their needs in short narratives, often with one or more example items that fit that need, against a background of historical preferences that may not be spelled out in the narrative, but do play a role in their considerations. Previous work has shown that numerous examples of such complex needs exist on the Web, yet current-generation systems offer limited to no support for these needs. In this paer, we focus on narrative-driven book recommendation in the context of LibraryThing users posting recommendation requests in the discussion forums. We propose several new algorithms that take advantage of these narratives and example items as well as hybrid systems, the majority of which significantly outperform classic collaborative filtering. We show that narrative-driven recommendation is indeed a complex scenario that requires further study. Our findings have consequences for system design and development not only in the book domain, but also in other domains where users express focused recommendation needs, such as movies, television, games, and music.",

abstract="Personalisation features are key to the success of many web applications and collaborative recommender systems have been widely implemented. These systems assist users in finding relevant information or products from the vast quantities that are frequently available. In previous work, we have demonstrated that such systems are vulnerable to attack and that recommendations can be manipulated. We introduced the concept of robustness as a performance measure, which is defined as the ability of a system to provide consistent predictions in the presence of noise in the data. In this paper, we expand on our previous work by examining the effects of several neighbourhood formation schemes and similarity measures on system performance. We propose a neighbourhood filtering mechanism for filtering false profiles from the neighbourhood in order to improve the robustness of the system.",

abstract="Collaborative filtering systems are essentially social systems which base their recommendation on the judgment of a large number of people. However, like other social systems, they are also vulnerable to manipulation by malicious social elements. Lies and Propaganda may be spread by a malicious user who may have an interest in promoting an item, or downplaying the popularity of another one. By doing this systematically, with either multiple identities, or by involving more people, malicious user votes and profiles can be injected into a collaborative recommender system. This can significantly affect the robustness of a system or algorithm, as has been studied in previous work. While current detection algorithms are able to use certain characteristics of shilling profiles to detect them, they suffer from low precision, and require a large amount of training data. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of shilling profiles and describe new approaches to detect malicious collaborative filtering profiles. In particular, we exploit the similarity structure in shilling user profiles to separate them from normal user profiles using unsupervised dimensionality reduction. We present two detection algorithms; one based on PCA, while the other uses PLSA. Experimental results show a much improved detection precision over existing methods without the usage of additional training time required for supervised approaches. Finally, we present a novel and highly effective robust collaborative filtering algorithm which uses ideas presented in the detection algorithms using principal component analysis.",

abstract="Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a new best-first search method that started a revolution in the field of Computer Go. Parallelizing MCTS is an important way to increase the strength of any Go program. In this article, we discuss three parallelization methods for MCTS: leaf parallelization, root parallelization, and tree parallelization. To be effective tree parallelization requires two techniques: adequately handling of (1) local mutexes and (2) virtual loss. Experiments in 13{\texttimes}13 Go reveal that in the program Mango root parallelization may lead to the best results for a specific time setting and specific program parameters. However, as soon as the selection mechanism is able to handle more adequately the balance of exploitation and exploration, tree parallelization should have attention too and could become a second choice for parallelizing MCTS. Preliminary experiments on the smaller 9{\texttimes}9 board provide promising prospects for tree parallelization.",

abstract="Collaborative filtering systems predict a user's interest in new items based on the recommendations of other people with similar interests. Instead of performing content indexing or content analysis, collaborative filtering systems rely entirely on interest ratings from members of a participating community. Since predictions are based on human ratings, collaborative filtering systems have the potential to provide filtering based on complex attributes, such as quality, taste, or aesthetics. Many implementations of collaborative filtering apply some variation of the neighborhood-based prediction algorithm. Many variations of similarity metrics, weighting approaches, combination measures, and rating normalization have appeared in each implementation. For these parameters and others, there is no consensus as to which choice of technique is most appropriate for what situations, nor how significant an effect on accuracy each parameter has. Consequently, every person implementing a collaborative filtering system must make hard design choices with little guidance. This article provides a set of recommendations to guide design of neighborhood-based prediction systems, based on the results of an empirical study. We apply an analysis framework that divides the neighborhood-based prediction approach into three components and then examines variants of the key parameters in each component. The three components identified are similarity computation, neighbor selection, and rating combination.",
