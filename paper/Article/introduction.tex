\section{Introduction}

  %To specify, what theory and which challenges we will work with, we formulate the problem statement below:
  %\begin{center}
    %\textit{How can we define and use structural similarity on graphs for recommendation tasks?}
  %\end{center}

  %Furthermore, we will also discuss the following:
  %\begin{itemize}
  %  \item What current Machine Learning methods can help define and compute structural similarity between nodes in a graph?
  %  \item Which sets of features for nodes and subgraphs will generate good recommendations?
  %  \item What relevant theory, data structures and metrics are available for discovering and processing structural similarity on graphs?
  %  \item How can graph based similarity methods help solve some of the challenges with regards to recommender systems?
  %\end{itemize}
