\section{Implementation}\label{Implementation}
In this section we will describe how our data has been setup and how our various method have been implemented. Subsection \ref{TET_features} and \ref{TET_historgram_and_distance} will focus on describing how our TET features how we compare them. Subsection \ref{GED} will describe how GED works. Subsection \ref{Metric_Tree_rep} and lastly in subsection \ref{node2vec} and \ref{brute_force} we describe how we implemented node2vec and a brute force comparison method.
