\section{Implementation}\label{Sec:Implementation}
In this section we will describe how our data has been setup and how the various methods have been implemented. \autoref{Subsec:TET_features} and \autoref{Subsec:TET_historgram_and_distance} will focus on describing our TET features and how we compare them.
\autoref{Subsec:Metric_Tree_rep} will describe how we use Metric Trees in order to compare a large amount of TETs. We end this section by describing how we implemented node2vec and a brute force comparison method in subsection \autoref{Subsec:n2v_implementation} and \autoref{Subsec:brute_force}.
