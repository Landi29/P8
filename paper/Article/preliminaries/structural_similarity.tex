\subsection{Structural Similarity}
Structural similarity is a widely used term that is used in many different areas, including graph comparison. The way that we define structural similarity is, that when looking at two graphs or subgraphs we look at the nodes from one graphs and comparing them with nodes from another graph. Similarity between the nodes is done by checking the type of adjacent nodes connected to the currently observed nodes and seeing if the node in the other graph has a similar set of adjacent nodes connected to it.
