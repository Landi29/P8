\section{The Problem Statement}
  To specify, what theory and which challenges we will work with, we formulate the problem statement below:
  How can we define and use structural similarity in graphs for recommendation tasks?
  Furthermore, we will also discuss the following:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What current Machine Learning methods can help define and compute structural similarity between nodes in a graph?
    \item Which sets of features for nodes and subgraphs will generate good recommendations?
    \item What relevant theory, data structures and metrics are available for discovering and processing structural similarity in graphs?
    \item How can graph based similarity methods help solve some of the challenges with regards to recommendation systems?
    \item What challenges are there with regards to recommender systems and how can graph based similarity methods help solve some of them?
  \end{itemize}
