\section{TET Features}
The TET that is built will be rooted in user U.
U is a user-node in the graph if $User(U) = True$. 

The feature User are in the boolean domain meaning that this feature will be either true or false(\autoref{Eq:Userdomain}).
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:Userdomain}
User(U)\rightarrow \{True, False\}
\end{equation}

Rating is a feature which is either low, medium or high and the original rating has been split into these three categories.
The original ratings is a numerical value between 0 and 5, which was then translated into the new form where $low<2.5\leq mid \leq 3.5<high$(\autoref{Eq:Ratingdomain}).

\begin{equation}\label{Eq:Ratingdomain}
Rating(U, M) \rightarrow \{Low, Mid, High\}
\end{equation}

Each renre in the dataset are afeature in the boolian domain. These feature will return a value when given a movie M, returns true if M is categorised as the genre(\autoref{Eq:genredomain}).
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:genredomain}
\begin{aligned}
Action(M) \rightarrow \{True, False\} \\
Comedy(M) \rightarrow \{True, False\} \\
\vdots \\
Western(M) \rightarrow \{True, False\} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The TETs constructed from the movielens dataset will be represented with the structure shown in \autoref{Eq:TETstructure}.
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:TETstructure}
User(U) \stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow} Rating(U,M) \longrightarrow Genre(M)
\end{equation}

The TET will represent a neighbourhood of the graph with a User as the root.

The sub-trees are themselves TETs as shown in \autoref{Eq:subtetstructure}.
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:subtetstructure}
\begin{aligned}
Rating(U,M)& \longrightarrow Action(M) \\
Rating(U,M)& \longrightarrow Comedy(M)\\
& \vdots \\
Rating(U,M)& \longrightarrow Western(M)
\end{aligned}	
\end{equation}

All of these functions has a been intended to work as if they were programmed in a logical paradigm. 

With the functions that can give a boolean result such as User(U) or any of the genres for example Action(M) we are only interested in True values. The tree will therefore have a end up having this form seen in \autoref{fig:Tetekempel}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \end{adjustbox}

\end{figure}

%The value of a TET T(X) for a user U will be denoted as V(T(U)). If the node U is not a user or is not part of domain, the value for the tree default to false.\todo{this part has to be more precise and telling look at bottom of p.39 in tet article}

The tree can also be represented as \autoref{Eq:TETvector}

\begin{equation}\label{Eq:TETvector}
    T(U)=
    \begin{cases}
      (low \{(action:t),(casual:t), (romance:t)\}):2 \\
      (low \{(action:t),(horror:t)\}):1 \\
      (mid \{(comedy:t),(romance:t)\}):1 \\
      (high\{(adventure:t),(romance:t)\}):1
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

This tells that the tree T(U) has 2 movies whith low rating and the genres action, casual, and romance, a movie rated low that has action and horror. there is a movire rated in the mid range with comedy and romance and a movie thas highly rated with adventure and romance.

Whith this structure we have a representetation of an users preferences and subgraph in a dataset. 
The structures can be compared to find simularities and therefore make more trustworty recomendation to an user.
