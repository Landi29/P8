\subsection{Node2Vec and the size of input data}\label{AP:N2V}

With:
success: nodes:221588 Edges:25000095
Summing the neighbors of nodes
The average number of neighbors for a node is: 225.64484538873947
and size of float equal to 8 bytes, the function will use 180,7984008 GB of memory. This is even one of the lowest estimates, since we set the size of float to be equal to 8 bytes. For floats with size 24 bytes, the function will use 542 GB of memory.
