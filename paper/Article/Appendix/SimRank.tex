\subsection{SimRank}
\label{Subsec:SimRank}
A popular algorithm for computing the similarity between substructures in graphs is SimRank, created by Jeh et al.\cite{10.1145/775047.775126}.
The intuition behind the SimRank algorithm is as the author states in the paper \emph{"two objects are similar if they are referenced by similar objects"}\cite{10.1145/775047.775126}.
The algorithm assigns a similarity score between 0 and 1 based on how similar two objects are.

We looked into using SimRank as a way to find the similarity of nodes in a graph network, using the data described in \autoref{Subsec:setup}. Where we have an undirected graph with users movie ratings as a way to find structual equivalence between the users in the graph and be able to recommend movies based on the similarity, like is done with the other methods explained in \autoref{Subsec:setup}.

We compute SimRank for a graph $G = (V,E)$ via iterating to fixed-point.
Let $n = |V|$ be the number of nodes within graph $G$, for each iteration $k$ we keep $n^2$ entries $R_k(*,*)$ of length $n^2$.
$R_k(a,b)$ where $\{a,b\} \in V$, gives the similarity score between $a$ and $b$ on iteration $k$\cite{10.1145/775047.775126}.
We compute $R_{k+1}(a,b)$ based on prior iteration $R_k(a,b)$.
First we compute $R_0(a,b)$ which is the lower bound of the similarity score.

\begin{definition}[Simrank]\label{def:simrank} Given two objects $a$ and $b$ as input, we compute the similarity $R_k+1(a,b) \in [0,1]$ based on the prior similarities $R_k(*,*)$.

For iteration $R_0$ the similarity scores are initialized by the equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lowerbound_sim_score}
R_0(a,b)= \begin{cases}
0, & (\text{if } a \neq b) \\

1 ,& (\text{if } a = b)
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

To compute $R_{k+1}(a,b)$ from $R_k(*,*)$ we use the equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:simrank_computation}
R_{k+1}(a,b)= \frac{C}{|I(a)||I(b)|}\sum^{|I(a)|}_{i=1}\sum^{|I(b)|}_{j=1}s(I_i(a),I_j(b))
\end{equation}

\end{definition}

What \autoref{eq:simrank_computation} states is that for $a \neq b$ and $R_{k+1}(a,b) = 1$ for $a = b$ we update for $(a,b)$ on each iteration $k+1$ using the similarity of the neighbors of $(a,b)$ from the previous iteration $k$. The values $R_k(*,*)$ are nondecreasing as $k$ increases.

In \autoref{def:simrank}, $C$ is the confidence level or decay factor which is a constant between $0$ and $1$, $I(n)$ is the in-neighbours for a node $n \in V$.
We compute the similarity $R_k(a,b)$ by iterating through all neighbor pairs between $a$ and $b$, summing up all the similarities of each pair and then dividing it by the total number of neighbors to normalize the value.
This means that the similarity between two nodes $a$ and $b$ is found by taking the average similarity of neighbors of these points. An object is always fully similar with itself so $s(a,a) = 1$.
