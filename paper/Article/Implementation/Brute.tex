\subsection{Brute force comparison}\label{Subsec:brute_force}
One of the most simple methods of comparing users in data set is to compare all relations one by one. 
In an unweighted graph if there was a relation from a user $A$ to a product $p$ and a relation from user $B$ to $p$ there would be a distance $d$ of 0 between these users assuming that this is the only relation user A and B has. 
A weighted graph the distance would also depend on the relation weight, if $A$ has a relation to $p$ with a weight of 2 and $B$ with a relation to $p$ with a weight of 3, using Manhattan distance there would a distance of 1 between $A$ and $B$. 
This can then be extended to all product relations $P$ as seen in \autoref{eq:manhat}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:manhat}
	d(A,B) = \sum_{i=1}^{P} |A_i - B_i|
\end{equation}
