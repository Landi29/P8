\subsection{TET Histograms and Distance}
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
	Comparing the TET can be done in different ways. One of the methods that can be used to find similarity between the TETs is to transform the TETs into histograms and compare these\cite{JAEGER201330}. By counting the number of each type of subTET we can calculate each substructure's percentile distribution for \autoref{fig:Tet_example}, by dividing the number of subTET in a specific type by the total number of subTETs. The simple TET in \autoref{Eq:TETvector} would give a representation as \autoref{fig:Tethistogram}.

	By using this representation as a vector we can compare two histograms with simple distance measures as for example manhatten or euclidean distance.

	when comparing two histograms, one might have some elements that the other does not have. For any missing element in a histogram we add the value $0$, and we are thereby able to calculate distance for the missing element. A simple example done with manhatten distance can be seen in \autoref{Eq:manhattencomparason}\cite{singh2013k}.

	By using comparing the key for each level in the tree, you can find the structural difference, for example if comparing two TET we know that if the users in the TETs are the same $User(u) == User(u')$ then we work on the same tree and the distance is $0$. The next level is the rating level for \autoref{fig:Tetekempel} this levels histogram would be represented as \autoref{fig:Tethistogram}, on this level we compare low, medium and high by assigning them a numeric value.
	
	On the genre level of the TET structure we find the difference between we see in \autoref{fig:Tethistogram} that $low\{(a:t)(c:t)(r:t)\}$ at this level we have $(a:t)(c:t)(r:t)$ we can use manhatten distance at this level by considering it as a vector there comparison with another histogram with less true genre features than the other at this level can the be compared as seen in \autoref{Eq:manhattencomparason}\cite{singh2013k}.

	\begin{equation}\label{Eq:manhattencomparason}
	D(\begin{bmatrix}
	x_{1.1} \\
	x_{1.2} \\
	x_{1.3}
	\end{bmatrix},
	\begin{bmatrix}
	x_{2.1} \\
	x_{2.2}
	\end{bmatrix})= |x_{1.1} - x_{2.1}| + |x_{1.2} - x_{2.2}| + |x_{1.3} - 0|
	\end{equation}

	\autoref{Eq:manhattencomparason} is easily implemented if the vectors are represented as dictionaries. We can then go through the union of dictionary keys from the two dictionaries and return $0$ if a key is not found. The value $0$ will then be used in the calculation.
=======
	
	The general formula for these comparisons can be seen in \autoref{eq:compare_tet} and \autoref{Eq:manhattencomparason}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:compare_tet}
	\begin{split}
	D(h,h') = \sum_{i=1}^{max(|h|,|h'|)} & (D(h^{\downarrow}, h'^{\downarrow})+ D(h_key, h'_key))  \\
	& * distribution(h) * distribution (h')
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	
	In \autoref{eq:compare_tet} $h^{\downarrow}$ meaning the TETs next level histogram representation. The $distribution()$ adds the impotence of each of the type of subTETs.
