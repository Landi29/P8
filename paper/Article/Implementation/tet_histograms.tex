\subsection{TET Histograms and Distance}
	Comparing the TET can be done in different ways. One of the method used to find similarity between the TETs is to transform the TET into a histogram is representing the by using the vector representation from \autoref{Eq:TETvector} we can calculate each substructures percentile distribution. this would give a representation as \autoref{fig:Tethistogram}
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{adjustbox}{width=0.5\textwidth}
			\input{Article/figures/TET_histogram.tex}
		\end{adjustbox}
		\caption{caption}
		\label{fig:Tethistogram}
	\end{figure}
	
	By using this representation as a vector we can compare two histograms with simple distance measures as forekamle manhatten or euclidean distance.
	
	When comparing two histograms they will most likely have some elements the other does not have the histogram without the element will simply get 0 for the missing value and thereby be able to add distance for the missing element. A simple example done with manhattan distance can be seen in \autoref{Eq:manhattencomparason}.
	
	\begin{equation}\label{Eq:manhattencomparason}
	D(\begin{bmatrix}
	x_{1.1} \\
	x_{1.2} \\
	\end{bmatrix},
	\begin{bmatrix}
	x_{2.1} \\
	x_{2.2} \\
	x_{2.3}
	\end{bmatrix})= |x_{1.1} - x_{2.1}| + |x_{1.2} - x_{2.2}| + |0 - x_{2.3}|
	\end{equation}
	
	This is easily implemented if the vectors are programmed as dictionaries by going through, the union of keywords in the two dictionaries and returning 0 it a key is not found.
