The cold start problem is a well known problem for recommenders\cite{Ricci2015}\cite{saveski2014item}.
The basis of the problem is that a data set is 
inadequate leading to recommendation problems.
Within the cold start problem there are a few sub problems, one of these are item cold start.
The item cold start is a problem that occurs with new data sets or when new items are added to the data set.
At these times in the recommenders life cycle there are no relations between users and items.
This fact makes it near impossible to make reliable recommendations.
The TETs predictions can work around the recommendation problem that addition happens when adding to the data set, by finding structurally similar items and using their ratings in the prediction calculation.
