\subsection{TET 10 folds and analasys}
each of the tests had an average run time of 1 hour and 12 minutes.  Fold 6 had the fasted run time of about 48 minutes but this fold might have a fitting problem as seen by the gap between validation and test error

In the graph of relative errors seen on \autoref{fig:tet_errors} we see that for most folds the lie at about $3.75$ error and that the fold with the lowest validation error has one of the biggest gap to test error this indicates a fitting mistake. 

Fold 5 and Fold 9 both have some interesting properties fold 9 has the same error for validation and test witch indicates a more general fold. Fold 5 has less error and thereby more accuracy and with and error difference between validation of 0.01 this might be the most reliable fold.
