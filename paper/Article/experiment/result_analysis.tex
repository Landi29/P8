\subsection{Result analysis}\label{Subsec:results}
The results of each test will in this section be compared to the baseline RMSE as seen in \autoref{fig:base_errors}, and with the RMSE score of the different methods.

\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:base_errors} we have the baseline RMSE, we got this by using the average rating for the dataset as the prediction for all future ratings.

\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:brute_errors} show the RMSE for the 20 evaluations. 
This shows that with a relatively simple method, recommendations can be done better than the baseline.
\autoref{fig:brute_errors} also shows that the RMSE in most folds only have a difference of $0.01$ between validation and test sets.

\end{figure}

The graph in \autoref{fig:N2V_errors} shows the most promising of our results with RMSE values being as low as 0.94 . By tweaking the metadata of the training we believe that there are potential for even better recommendations.
The discrepancy between validation and test in fold 7 seems to indicate that this fold has been fitted wrongly.

\end{figure}


The RMSE scores for the TETs seen in \autoref{fig:tet_errors}, are at a glance not impressive, but the RMSE scores are still better than the baseline. 
This shows potential in the framework and it might be better with more descriptive features. The advantage of recommendation with TETs, is that it can depend only on structural information.
Where the other methods we have discussed are dependent on the nearest neighbors having rated a product or movie to make a recommendation, the TETs only need movies or products that look like the movie or product you try to predict a recommendation for.
