\section{Reliability}
We will now recall some theory on Reliability and use it to evaluate the reliability of our solution. In order to prove Reliability, we can construct several hypotheses that together ensure a notion of reliability for our system. In the theory on
Experiments and Evaluation, hypotheses are categorized into two categories called \textit{one sample hypothesis} and \textit{two sample hypothesis}.
