\section{Preliminaries}\label{preliminaries}
In this section we will describe various theories related to recommender systems and graphs which are used throughout this study. We start out by describing overall recommender system method in subsection \ref{recommenders}. We then describe what structural similarity means to us in subsection \ref{structural_similarity}. Afterward we move on to describing the theory behind various graph related methods starting with node embedding in subsection \ref{Graph_embedding}, then the SimRank algorithm in subsection \ref{SimRank} and lastly the node2vec algorithm in subsection \ref{Sec:node2vec_prelim}.
