\subsection{Recommenders}
In this section there an introduction to recommender systems.

There are different types of recommender systems and in this paper we focus on the types that might work on sub graphs.

\begin{definition}[Content-based recommendation] \label{def:Content_based_recommendation}
A recommendation system that analyses items preferred by a user to find common attributes of the items, and compares these attributes to attributes of other items to find simultaneities\cite{lu2015recommender}. 
\end{definition}

Content-based recommendation as defined in definition \ref{def:Content_based_recommendation} are not dependent on other users but the attributes of the items.

\begin{definition}[Collaborative filtering-based]\label{def:Collaborative_filtering_based}
A recommender system that represents user or items as vectors, such that a simulation can be calculated between vectors\cite{lu2015recommender}.
\end{definition}

Collaborative filtering-based recommenders defined in definition \ref{def:Collaborative_filtering_based}, depend on other items or users. These systems therefore gives users trust in the answer but often has the cold start problem.
